How to stop the App Installer popup when left-clicking the widget (e.g. offline)
===============================================================================

Option A - Use full path to Python (recommended)
------------------------------------------------
1. Open Command Prompt (Win+R, type cmd, Enter).
2. Run:  where pythonw
3. Copy the path shown (e.g. C:\Users\...\pythonw.exe)
4. Open local.inc in a text editor (in the same folder as DSATracker.ini).
5. Uncomment the PythonPath and PythonParam lines (remove the ; at the start).
6. Set PythonPath= to your path from step 2 (add quotes if it has spaces).
7. Save and refresh the skin (right-click skin -> Refresh).

Option B - Turn off Windows alias
----------------------------------
1. Open Windows Settings (Win+I).
2. Go to: Apps -> Advanced app settings -> App execution aliases
3. Find "pythonw" (or "App Installer - pythonw") and turn it OFF.
4. Refresh the skin.

After either option, left-clicking the widget when offline should no longer open the App Installer.
